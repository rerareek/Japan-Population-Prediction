# Japan-Population-Prediction
This project predicts Japan's population trends using regression models based on factors like birth rate, death rate, and employment rate. Linear Regression emerged as the best model, though improvements are needed for accuracy. Findings suggest Japanâ€™s population will continue to decline due to low birth rates and rising death rates.
