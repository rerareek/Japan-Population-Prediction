# Japan-Population-Prediction
This repository contains our group project focused on forecasting Japan's population trends using regression models. Leveraging time-series data on key indicators like birth rate, death rate, and employment rate, we explored various machine learning models, with Linear Regression, KNN, and Decision Trees. Throughout the test, Linear Regression performed best, but further improvements are needed for accuracy.

### Project Details:
- **Dataset**: Time-series data on Japan's population-related indicators
- **Models Tested**: Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, MLP Regressor
- **Evaluation Metrics**: R², MAE, RMSE, MSE
- **Key Findings**: Predictions indicate Japan’s population will continue declining due to persistently low birth rates and rising death rates.

This project serves as a resource for those interested in demographic forecasting and the application of regression models in population studies.
